# Contributing

## Commit messages and Branch names

- Try to use your best judgement for these: there are no rules!
- It's best have your commit messages describe the changes that you have made
- And your branch names to describe the feature you are implementing
- (It's not that deep)

## Where to put code

- If you're not sure where to put code, check out [the structure of the project](/resources/programming/lightborne-structure.md).
- If it's still not clear, feel free to make your best judgement, or ask on Discord!
- Moving code around is a lot easier than writing it.

## Making a pull request

- Once you have committed and pushed all of your changes to your fork, make a Pull Request on the main repository.
- It is somewhat likely that there will be merge conflicts. If you're not sure how to resolve the conflict,
    1. Follow this guide to [allow maintainers (me!) to edit the merge request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork#enabling-repository-maintainer-permissions-on-existing-pull-requests)
    2. Ping me on Discord: I'll hop in a call and merge your commit with you!
